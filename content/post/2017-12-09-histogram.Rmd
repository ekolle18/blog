Lets use a histogram to look at the weight distribution of professional baseball players.
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

#visualizing the data

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="yellow",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body-Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
