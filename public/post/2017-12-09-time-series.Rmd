We can use a time series plot to view data over time. Lets use a time series plot to look at Babe Ruth's home run totals for each season he played.
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#extracting the data

query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)

#visualizing the data

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="black")+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Totals Through the Years")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")
```
