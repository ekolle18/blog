Lets compare players strikout totals to their strikeout totals by using a scatterplot.
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#extracting data

query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,
sum(SO) AS career_SO FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)

#visualizing data

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=1,color="green")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts v. Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
